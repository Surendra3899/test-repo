DevOps is a cultural philosophy, set of practices, and collection of tools that 
combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to automate and integrate
 the processes of delivering high-quality software faster and more reliably. 
 It breaks down traditional silos, fostering collaboration, shared ownership, 
 and a continuous feedback loop across the entire software lifecycle, 
 from planning to monitoring, to deliver value to customers more quickly.
